>python, ML, Ensemble methods, Booosting, CatBoost, Streamlit, web development, Scikit-learn
## Features

- [Streamlit]([https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/](https://docs.streamlit.io/))
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/en/docs/)

I've used Scikit-learn, CatBoost and Streamlit web framework based in Python.
It was necessary to use Scikit-learn, CatBoostClassifier for Machine Learning and Streamlit, which provides configuration and conventions, with sensible defaults.

## Explaining the project
My final project is a web app written in python that allows the user to enter client's ??? to get wage prediction.

## project.py for Machine Learning, test_project.py for testing, app.py for a website in which this ML model predicts the candidate wage
All information about ??? for each client are stored in job_search.csv.


### ML model can be saved in file with ".pkl" extension


## Demonstration on the website
For final project you have to make a website,

## About "ML service development: from idea to prototype"
"ML service development: from idea to prototype" is a Bootcamp from Higher School of Economics and taught by Elena K. Olegovna

The course is based on the basic principles of data processing and building simple machine learning models, as well as conclusions about the finished product! In the course, you will get acquainted with the field of data analysis and machine learning, as well as learn how to use a simple and very beautiful tool for creating web services - Streamlit.
